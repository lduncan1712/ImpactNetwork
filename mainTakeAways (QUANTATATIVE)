AVERAGE EDGES STRENGTH;

## EdgeStrengthRatios:
### Among all References (by All Participants)
#### 11% (tier 4 referneces)
#### 17% (tier 3 references)
#### 29% (tier 2 references)
#### 43% (tier 1 references)
#### (meaning the average person wrote 4 people in the lowest category for every 1 in the upper)

## Corralation To (trait0)
## (Trait0 held the identity of someones pre-secondary school 1/7)
### (Idea being people who share this will have known the other members longer (+1-3year))

#### 98% of people referenced at least someone with an identical trait0
#### 91% of people referenced multiple people with an identical trait0
#### 43% of people referered a majority of people with an identical trait0
#### (seems low, but given pre-secondary population spread between 7+ institutions, disproportionate)
#### 65% of people's closest match (meaning either only member in their highest referenced tier, 
or that and person with highest ratio of reference to them/ total references made) shared trait0


## Corralation To (trait1)
### (trait1 held the length of time spend at this secondary school (1-4+)
#### 88% of participants had trait1 = 4 (the largest amount of time)
#### 7% of participants had trait1 = 3 (3/4 largest)
#### 4% of participants had trait1 = 2 (1/2 largest)
#### 1% of participants had trait1 = 1 (1/4 largest)


## Corralation To (trait2)
### (trait2 held the future post seconary plans of participants 1/7)
#### 86% of participant's closest reference (see above) shared trait2
#### 74% of all participants, highest tier of references solely shared trait2
#### 99% of all participants, made at least one 'edge' reference that shared trait2
#### 94% of all participants, made at least one 'edge' reference (in the highest tier/or the highest they referenced) that shared trait2


## Corralation To (trait3)
### (trait3 held self described personality tendancy of participants (Introverted/Extraverted)
#### 57% described themselves as extraverted
#### 43% described themselves as extraverted
