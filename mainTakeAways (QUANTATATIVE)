AVERAGE EDGES STRENGTH;

## EdgeStrengthRatios:
### Among all References (by All Participants)
#### 11% (tier 4 referneces)
#### 17% (tier 3 references)
#### 29% (tier 2 references)
#### 43% (tier 1 references)
#### (meaning the average person wrote 4 people in the lowest category for every 1 in the upper)

## Corralation To (trait0)
## (Trait0 held the identity of someones pre-secondary school)
### (Idea being people who share this will have known the other members longer (+1-3year))

#### 98% of people referenced at least someone with an identical trait0
#### 91% of people referenced multiple people with an identical trait0
#### 43% of people referered a majority of people with an identical trait0
#### (seems low, but given pre-secondary population spread between 7+ institutions, disproportionate)
#### 65% of people's closest match (meaning either only member in their highest referenced tier, 
or that and person with highest ratio of reference to them/ total references made) shared trait0
